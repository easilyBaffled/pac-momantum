This game is an odd physics based mashup between Pac-Man and Pool. Instead of needed power pellets to get rid of Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde, Pac-Man needs to ram into the ghosts hard enough for them to burst. 
Build up momentum by charging down long stretches of the maze, slingshot Pac-Man through the looping portals, or get an small burst by eating pellets. 
Bounce ghosts off one another to pull off fun trick shots.

## Matter.js 
This game is meant not only to be fun(!) but also as an experiment. I am trying out the [Matter.js](http://brm.io/matter-js/)) library for the first time. Matter.js is a popular Rigid-body 2D physics engine for javascript. 
I want to see how much code it takes to set up a basic physics simulation and what it takes to ensure that it’s performant. And if all goes well create a set of utilities and boilerplate to simplify making games in the future.
